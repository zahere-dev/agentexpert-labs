# Brand Watch AI Agent

This project provides an automated workflow to monitor how your brand appears across AI answer engines such as ChatGPT and Perplexity. As user discovery shifts from traditional search engines to AI-driven answer generators, maintaining visibility in these systems becomes essential. The Brand Watch Agent analyzes your brand’s presence, evaluates competitor mentions, and reveals the content sources that influence AI-generated recommendations.

A walkthrough and demonstration of this workflow are available in the accompanying video:

## Overview

The Brand Watch AI Agent performs the following tasks:

- Scrapes and analyzes your website content.
- Identifies your business domain, services, and target geography.
- Generates customer-intent queries relevant to your category.
- Tests these queries against AI answer engines.
- Detects whether your brand is cited.
- Captures competitor citations and compares visibility.
- Surfaces the external sources (directories, review pages, listicles, social posts) that AI models rely on.

## Why This Matters

AI answer engines now provide direct, authoritative responses to user queries. If your brand is not recognized or properly represented in those answers, potential customers may never encounter your business during the discovery phase. Monitoring ensures:

- Visibility in AI-driven recommendations.
- Identification of content gaps.
- Understanding of how AI models perceive your brand.
- Awareness of competitor positioning.
- Insight into which sources influence the responses.

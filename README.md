# 🧠 OpenAI MCP BMI Tool – Client & Server Demo

This project demonstrates how to build a simple MCP (Model Context Protocol) client and server using OpenAI's `openai` Python SDK and the `mcp` package. We expose a BMI calculator tool via the server and use an LLM-powered client to discover and invoke the tool based on natural language queries.
